Melvin Jamon Frazier Jr. (born August 30, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for Tulane.
Frazier attended L. W. Higgins High School. He played AAU basketball for Team NOLA and Wings Elite, where he was a defensive force but secondary scorer to Marlain Veal. Frazier was ranked the fourth best prospect in Louisiana by The Times-Picayune as a senior. He chose Tulane over offers from Arkansas, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.
Frazier was coach Ed Conroy's highest-rated recruit but had a relatively quiet freshman season, averaging 5.2 points per game. When Mike Dunleavy Sr. arrived as coach in his sophomore season, he worked to improve Frazier's shooting mechanics and dribbling skills. Frazier averaged 11.5 points per game as a sophomore. He was named AAC player of the week for the first time on November 20, 2017. As a junior, Frazier had 10 games where he scored at least 20 points, including a career-high 28 points against Memphis. He sustaining a chest contusion early in the game against Temple on February 4 and missed a game. Frazier was named to the Second Team All-AAC as well as the Most Improved Player. He averaged 15.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.1 steals per game as a junior, while shooting 55.8 percent from the floor and 39 percent from behind the arc. After the season he declared for the 2018 NBA draft but did not immediately hire an agent. He was considered to be a borderline first round prospect. In May, Frazier signed with Thad Foucher of Wasserman Media Group, thus ending his collegiate eligibility.
On June 21, 2018, Frazier was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the 35th overall selection in the 2018 NBA draft. On July 6, 2018, the Magic announced that they had signed with Frazier.
