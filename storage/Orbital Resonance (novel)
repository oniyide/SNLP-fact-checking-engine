Orbital Resonance (novel)
Orbital Resonance is a science fiction novel by John Barnes. It is the first of four books comprising the Century Next Door series, followed by Kaleidoscope Century, Candle, The Sky So Big and Black.
Orbital Resonance was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991.
Writer Jo Walton declared: "This may be Barnes’s best book. (Or that may be A Million Open Doors.) It’s a book almost everyone who likes SF will enjoy, and if it gives you a lot to think about as well, then that’s all to the good."
