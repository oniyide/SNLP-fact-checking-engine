Terrance Ferguson
Terrance Eugene Ferguson Jr. (born May 17, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He completed high school at Advanced Preparatory International in Dallas, Texas, where he was a top-20 player in the Class of 2016. Ferguson made separate commitments to both Alabama and Arizona before deciding to skip college and play overseas in 2016–17. Ferguson is a three-time gold medalist with Team USA, and in 2016, he participated in the McDonald's All-American Game and the Nike Hoop Summit, winning the MVP award at the latter.
Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Ferguson moved to Dallas, Texas as a youth and enrolled at Prime Prep Academy. He joined the school's basketball team and played for coach Ray Forsett. As a freshman in 2012–13, Ferguson averaged 10 points per game and helped his team to a 38–2 record, the 2013 NACA Division I Tournament title, and the 2013 National High School Invitational semifinals. He was named to the NACA All-Tournament Team and earned NACA Tournament MVP honors.
In January 2015, halfway through his junior year at Prime Prep Academy, the school closed amid allegations of theft and the mishandling of funds. In September 2015, a new institution known as Advanced Preparatory International opened in place of Prime Prep. Coach Ray Forsett subsequently joined the ranks at Advanced Prep, while four players, including Ferguson, moved over from Prime Prep with Forsett to play for Advanced Prep in 2015–16.
Heading into his senior year of high school, Ferguson was ranked No. 11 overall in the Class of 2016's ESPN 100. He averaged 17.0 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game for Advanced Prep in 2015–16, earning a trip to the McDonald's All-American Game. As a starter for the East team, Ferguson scored 10 points in a 114–107 loss to the West.
On April 9, 2016, Ferguson scored 21 points, all on three-pointers, to help the USA Junior National Select Team defeat the World Select Team 101–67 at the Moda Center. It was the most lopsided victory in Nike Hoop Summit history. Ferguson's seven threes broke the Nike Hoop Summit record for threes made; the previous record of six was shared by Xavier Henry (2009) and Casey Jacobsen (1999). He subsequently earned MVP honors. Prior to the Nike Hoop Summit, Ferguson boasted a 19–0 record with Team USA; he made it 20–0 with USA's Summit win. On April 30, he won the Ballislife All-American Game dunk contest after performing a free throw line dunk.
In January 2015, coach Rick Pitino of the University of Louisville began heavily recruiting Ferguson. Other teams showing interest in Ferguson at the time were Kansas, Baylor, Oklahoma State, Oklahoma, Arizona, North Carolina, Wichita State, Iowa State, UCLA, Wake Forest, Arkansas and Maryland.
In August 2015, Ferguson committed to play for Alabama in 2016–17. However, he never signed a letter of intent, and when the early signing period passed in November without Ferguson signing, other schools began contacting Ferguson. This led to Ferguson decommitting from Alabama on March 1, 2016. On April 13, he committed to Arizona, the first day of the spring signing period, but did not sign a letter of intent despite indications he would, eventually signing non-binding financial aid papers.
His commitment to Arizona lasted until early June when rumors emerged that Ferguson had decided to skip college for a chance to play overseas in 2016–17. On June 6, Australia was deemed the most likely destination, with the Adelaide 36ers rumored to be close to formalizing a deal with Ferguson. By the end of the month, Ferguson had informed Wildcats coach Sean Miller of his decision to pursue professional opportunities instead of attending Arizona.
On July 1, 2016, Ferguson signed with the Adelaide 36ers for the 2016–17 NBL season. On October 7, 2016, he made his debut for the 36ers in their season opener against the Illawarra Hawks. In 17½ minutes off the bench, he scored 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting in a 122–88 loss. On October 14, 2016, he scored 13 points in a 98–87 loss to Melbourne United. On October 24, 2016, he was handed a two-game suspension for striking following the 36ers' Round 3 game against the Cairns Taipans on October 21. The incident occurred during the first quarter and involved Taipans' player Mark Worthington. By accepting the charge via an early guilty plea, only a one-game suspension was imposed. On January 19, 2017, he tied his season high with 13 points in a 101–68 win over the Brisbane Bullets. The 36ers finished the regular season in first place with a 17–11 record, but were knocked out in the semi-finals by the fourth-seeded Illawarra Hawks, losing the best-of-three series 2–1. Ferguson appeared in 30 of the team's 31 games in 2016–17, averaging 4.6 points and 1.2 rebounds in 15.2 minutes per game. Following the conclusion of the season, Ferguson returned to the US to begin preparations for the 2017 NBA draft.
On June 22, 2017, Ferguson was selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the 21st overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft. On July 29, 2017, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Thunder. On November 14, 2017, he was assigned to the Oklahoma City Blue of the NBA G League. He was recalled the next day. On January 3, 2018, in his first career start, Ferguson scored a career-high 24 points in a 133–96 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.
Ferguson was a member of the USA Basketball Men's U16 National Team that posted a 5–0 record en route to winning gold at the 2013 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship in Maldonado, Uruguay. He played in all five games and averaged 5.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game. The following year, he was a member of the USA U17 World Championship Team that posted a 7–0 record and captured the 2014 FIBA Under-17 World Championship gold medal in Dubai. Ferguson played in all seven games (with four starts) and averaged 9.0 points, 1.3 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game.
In July 2015, Ferguson won his third gold medal in as many years after helping Team USA go 7–0 at the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Heraklion, Greece. He played in all seven games and averaged 6.1 points, 1.6 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.
Ferguson is the son of Rachelle Holdman, and has one brother, Brandon, and one sister, Brittnay. His grandmother, Shiley Holdman, was in the U.S. Air National Guard.
