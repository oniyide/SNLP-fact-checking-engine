John Lund (February 6, 1911 â€“ May 10, 1992) was an American film actor who is probably best remembered for his role in the film A Foreign Affair (1948), directed by Billy Wilder, and a dual role in Mitchell Leisen's To Each His Own (1946). 
According to one obituary, his "film career was cut to a familiar pattern: the young actor imported to Hollywood after a big success on Broadway begins by playing the handsome guy who gets the girl, then descends by gradual degrees to being the male lead in minor westerns and occasionally, in major films, being the handsome guy who does not get the girl because he lacks the spark of the hero who does."
John Lund's father was a Norwegian immigrant and glassblower in Rochester, New York. Lund did not finish high school, and he tried several businesses before settling on advertising in the 1930s. His jobs included being "a soda-jerk, carpenter and timekeeper."
While working for an advertising agency, he was asked by a friend to appear in an industrial show for the 1939 World's Fair. As a result, he served as stage manager of Railroad on Parade at the fair and played several roles in the production. Before moving to New York City he had appeared in several amateur productions in Rochester.
He began acting professionally by appearing on Broadway in a production of William Shakespeare's As You Like It (1941) alongside Alfred Drake.
He wrote the book and lyrics for Broadway's New Faces of 1943 (1943), as well as appearing on stage.
It was his appearance in the play The Hasty Heart (1945) that got him recognized by Hollywood and led to a long-term film contract with Paramount Pictures.
Lund had the title role in the serial Chaplain Jim on the Blue Network in the early 1940s. Lund also played Johnny Dollar in the radio show Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar, taking over from 1952 until 1954.
Lund's first film had him as star To Each His Own (1946) with Olivia de Havilland for Paramount, in which he played dual roles. It was written and produced by Charles Brackett and was popular critically and commercially.
Paramount used Lund as Betty Hutton's leading man in The Perils of Pauline (1947), another hit. He was one of many Paramount stars who made cameos in Variety Girl (1947).
Billy Wilder then cast Lund in A Foreign Affair (1948), as romantic lead to both Marlene Dietrich and Jean Arthur. It was highly acclaimed but failed to make him a major star. 
He supported Edward G. Robinson in Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948). Brackett gave him the lead in a comedy Miss Tatlock's Millions (1948). He was the star of Bride of Vengeance (1949) alongside Paulette Goddard and MacDonald Carey but the film was a big flop.
Hal Wallis used him in My Friend Irma (1949) as Al, boyfriend of Irma (Marie Wilson). The film is best remembered however for introducing Martin and Lewis (Jerry Lewis had meant to play the role of Al but realised he was miscast).
He supported Barbara Stanwyck in No Man of Her Own (1950) and reprised his performance as Al in My Friend Irma Goes West (1950). Paramount announced Union Station for him but William Holden ended up playing it.
Lund went over to MGM to play the false love interest in Duchess of Idaho (1950) with Esther Williams and Van Johnson.
Brackett gave him another good role in The Mating Season (1951), alongside Gene Tierney, Miriam Hopkins, and Thelma Ritter. He was Joan Fontaine's leading man in Darling, How Could You! (1951).
Paramount wanted to loan him to Universal for Weekend with Father but he refused and was put on suspension.
Lund left Paramount for Universal, where he was Ann Sheridan's leading man in Steel Town (1952), replacing Jeff Chandler.
He co-starred with Chandler in The Battle at Apache Pass (1952) and Scott Brady in Bronco Buster (1952) the was reunited with Sheridan in Just Across the Street (1952). 
He was top billed in Woman They Almost Lynched (1953), a Western at Republic, although essentially he was supporting the female lead.
Lund played another false love interest at MGM Latin Lovers (1953) with Lana Turner.
He made a series of Westerns: White Feather (1955), at Fox, second billed to Robert Wagner; Five Guns West (1955), the first film directed by Roger Corman, at ARC; Chief Crazy Horse (1955) with Victor Mature at Universal; and Dakota Incident (1956) with Linda Darnell at Republic.
Around this time he was also in a war film at Columbia, Battle Stations (1956), and he played Grace Kelly's fiance George in MGM's High Society, the musical remake of MGM's 1940 greatly successful The Philadelphia Story.
He was top billed in Affair in Reno (1957) for Republic. His last performances included support performances in The Wackiest Ship in the Army (1960) at Columbia and If a Man Answers (1962) at Universal.
He retired from the screen in 1963, becoming a successful Hollywood businessman. Lund retired to his home in Coldwater Canyon in the Hollywood Hills in 1983 and died of heart problems in 1992.
Lund was married to Marie Charton, who was an actress and a model.
