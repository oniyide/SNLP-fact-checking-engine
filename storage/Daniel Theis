Daniel Theis (born April 4, 1992) is a German professional basketball player for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
Born in Salzgitter, Theis went through the Braunschweig youth system. He made his debut in the German top-tier level league, the Basketball Bundesliga, during the 2010–11 season. Theis primarily gained playing time with the club's development squad, where he played alongside his older brother, Frank, from 2010 to 2012. He earned the Eurobasket.com website's All-2.Pro B Most Improved Player of the Year honors in 2011. In Braunschweig, Theis was also a teammate of fellow NBA player Dennis Schröder.
In the 2013–14 season, while with ratiopharm Ulm, Theis won the BBL Best Young Player award. Following his breakout season with Ulm, Theis signed with fellow German Bundesliga club Brose Bamberg. In the 2014 off-season, he played in the 2014 NBA Summer League for the Washington Wizards' summer league team.
In the 2014–15 season, Theis won his first German League championship with Brose Baskets. Brose beat FC Bayern Munich 3–2 in the German League Finals. In April 2015, he signed a fresh two-year deal with the Bamberg team, and he won two more German championships with Bamberg, in 2016 and 2017.
On July 20, 2017, Theis signed with the Boston Celtics. He made his NBA debut on October 18 against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 12, 2018, Theis suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee, and missed the remainder of the 2017–18 season after Theis repaired his left knee lateral meniscus in a surgery.
On October 29, 2018, Theis was found to have a slight tear of the plantar fascia in his right foot and was scheduled to be out indefinitely, but he returned shortly after the injury on November 11 vs. the Portland Trail Blazers.
On July 17, 2019, the Boston Celtics announced that they had re-signed Theis, along with former Brose Bamberg teammate Brad Wanamaker. The contract was reported to be worth $10 million in total for the 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons

On July 27, 2014, Theis made his first appearance with the senior German national basketball team in a game against Finland. With Germany's senior team, he played at the EuroBasket 2015 qualification tournament.
