Admiral Donovhan Schofield (born March 30, 1997) is an American professional basketball player for the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Tennessee Volunteers.
Schofield, the son of Anthony and Dawn Schofield, was born at St Mary's Hospital in London while his father was stationed there with the U.S. Navy.  His brother O'Brien Schofield is a linebacker who won a Super Bowl with the Seattle Seahawks. He has another brother General and a sister Octavia; one other brother, Jordan, drowned in Lake Michigan in 2007. Admiral Schofield attended Zion-Benton High School where he played center. In his final high school game, he recorded 23 points with 18 rebounds against Stevenson in the Class 4A regional championship. In AAU play, he competed for Dickey Simpkins' Team NLP. Donnie Tyndall recruited him to Tennessee, but Schofield decided to stay after Tyndall was fired.
Schofield averaged 7.6 points and 4.0 rebounds per game as a freshman. He missed three games as a sophomore while he was suspended for violating team rules. He only scored 3.5 points per game in nonconference play, but began to break out during the conference season and had his first double-double of 18 points and 10 rebounds in a loss to Florida. As a sophomore at Tennessee, Schofield averaged 8.2 points and 4.4 rebounds per game.
Schofield was named to the SEC All-Tournament Team as a junior due to a 22-point effort in the SEC Title game loss to Kentucky. As a junior, Schofield averaged 13.9 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. He helped Tennessee to a 26–9 record and the second round of the NCAA tournament. In the first round win over Wright State, Schofield had 15 points and 12 rebounds. Schofield was named to the Second Team All-SEC. Following the season, he declared for the 2018 NBA draft but did not hire an agent, thus leaving open the possibility of returning to the Volunteers. Schofield announced his return to Tennessee on May 29.
As a senior, Schofield averaged 16.5 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. He was named to the First Team All-SEC. He led Tennessee to a 31–6 record and the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. In his final career game, a 99-94 overtime loss to Purdue, Schofield finished with 21 points.

On December 4, he became the first player in the Wizards organization to play a game for the Go-Go and Wizards in the same day.
