Kaufman met Australian-American actress Poppy Montgomery in 2005 in Mexico while working on the independent film Between. In 2010 they worked together again in the TV movie Lying to Be Perfect. At the time Montgomery played the role of FBI agent Samantha Spade on the CBS mystery drama Without a Trace.
