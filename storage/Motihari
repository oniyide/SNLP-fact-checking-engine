Motihari is the headquarters of East Champaran district in the Indian state of Bihar. It is located 150 kilometres north of the state capital Patna.

The topography of Motihari was wonderful scenic. The Motijheel Lake of stunning beauty (in classical terms) divides the town in two halves.
In Gangan Lit-Mag (Gangway Literary Magazine), Austria, wrote Anant Kumar: "The playgrounds of my childhood were the streets of Motihari. Back then that little East Indian town was not overpopulated, and the dry, clean streets of every part of town were ideal for our games: marbles, tops, badminton. And back then Motihari was a wide distance away from the big world. There were very many mango and lichee trees, fragrant lemon bushes, broad, large fields…and very few people. There were scattered decrepit hawelis and bungalows, in which frightening bhuts, geniis and juraels dwelled."
However, in current times, the city has witnessed large scale Rural to Urban migration, and thus is suffering from grave congestion, pollution and rise in land prices. Its Scenic beauty has clearly diminished. The Gandhi Sangrahalaya has a wide collection of relics and photographs of the Champaran Satyagraha. The Gandhian Memorial Pillar was designed by Nand Lal Bose, a famous artist of Shantiniketan.
The foundation stone of the pillar was laid on 10 June 1972 by the then Governor, D. K. Barooch. It is a 48 ft tall stone pillar and is situated at the same site where Mahatma Gandhi was presented in court.
