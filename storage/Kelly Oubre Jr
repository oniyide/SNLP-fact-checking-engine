Kelly Paul Oubre Jr. (born December 9, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Oubre played one season of college basketball for the University of Kansas before being selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 15th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft.
Oubre was the second child born in New Orleans, Louisiana to Kelly Oubre Sr. and Tonya Coleman (formerly Oubre). Oubre and his family lived in the Magnolia public housing complex from his birth until the early part of his childhood, later settling in the Eastover section of New Orleans. Oubre attended Edward Hynes Elementary School (now known as Hynes Charter School) and played for three Milne Boys Home (now known as New Orleans Recreation Development Commission) basketball teams during that time. Oubre's family moved to Richmond, Texas after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Oubre attended George Bush High School in Fort Bend, Texas before transferring to Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nevada for his senior season. In October 2013, Oubre committed to playing for the Kansas Jayhawks in 2014–15.
As a freshman at Kansas in 2014–15, Oubre was twice named Big 12 Newcomer of the Week and subsequently earned All-Newcomer Team honors. He also earned All-Big 12 Honorable Mention honors. In 36 games (27 starts) for the Jayhawks in 2014–15, Oubre averaged 9.3 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.1 steals in 21.0 minutes per game.
On April 1, 2015, Oubre declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility.
Oubre was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 15th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft. His draft rights were then traded to the Washington Wizards. On December 16, 2015, he scored a career-high 18 points on 6-of-15 shooting in a 114–95 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Throughout his limited playing time during his rookie season, Oubre showed signs of becoming an effective "3 and D" player.
On November 28, 2016, Oubre recorded his first career double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds in a 101–95 overtime win over the Sacramento Kings. On December 10, he scored a career-high 19 points to go with nine rebounds and three steals in Washington's 110–105 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. Oubre was suspended for game four of the Wizards' second-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics after he was ejected in game three for shoving Boston's Kelly Olynyk.
In 2017–18, Oubre scored over 20 points five times, including setting a career high with 26 points on January 19 in a 122–112 win over the Detroit Pistons. However, beginning the year shooting 44.9 percent from the field and 40.5 percent from the perimeter through 46 games, Oubre shot just 34.9 percent from the field and 27.4 percent from three in his last 35 games to close the regular season.
On December 10, 2018, Oubre scored a then season-high 23 points in a 109–101 loss to the Indiana Pacers.
On December 17, 2018, Oubre was traded with Austin Rivers to the Phoenix Suns for Trevor Ariza. He made his debut for the Suns two days later, scoring 13 points in a 111–103 win over the Boston Celtics. On January 8, 2019, Oubre matched his career high with 26 points in a 115–111 win over the Sacramento Kings. Four days later, he matched his career high with 26 points and tied his career best with 11 rebounds in a 102–93 win over the Denver Nuggets. On February 8, he recorded 25 points and a then career-high 12 rebounds in a 117–107 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On February 13, he scored a then career-high 28 points in a 134–107 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On March 4, he had 27 points and 13 rebounds in a 114–105 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 16, he scored a career-high 32 points in a 138–136 overtime win over the New Orleans Pelicans. On March 21, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a left thumb injury.
On July 16, 2019, Oubre signed a two-year, $30 million contract extension with the Phoenix Suns. On December 5, Oubre grabbed a career-high 15 rebounds alongside with 14 points and four blocks in a 139–132 overtime win over the New Orleans Pelicans.
