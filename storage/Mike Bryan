Michael Carl Bryan (born April 29, 1978) is an American professional tennis player. The right-hander turned pro in 1998. With his twin brother Bob, he has been world No. 1 doubles player for more than nine years, first achieving the top ranking in September 2003, and they became the second men's doubles team to complete the career Golden Slam by winning the 2012 Summer Olympics.
