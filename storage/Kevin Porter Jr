Kevin Porter Jr.
Bryan Kevin Porter Jr. (born May 4, 2000) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the USC Trojans. He played high school ball at Ranier Beach and led the Vikings to the state playoffs in each of his four years.
Porter was born in Seattle, Washington to Ayanna and Bryan Kevin Porter Sr. His father played football, basketball, and baseball at Rainier Beach High School in Seattle in the 1990s. In July 2004, when Kevin Jr. was four years old, his father was shot five times and killed while trying to help someone being attacked. As a result, he was raised by his mother, who became his role model. Porter played sports to both pay homage to his late father and recover from the loss of him.
Porter convinced his mother to enroll him at Rainier Beach High School instead of O'Dea High School in Seattle, because his father had played sports there and he wanted to preserve the tradition. In his senior campaign, he averaged 27 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 assists, as Rainier Beach finished with a 22–7 record. On March 3, 2018, Porter recorded 22 points and 11 rebounds in a Class 3A state championship game loss to Garfield High School. At the end of the season, he was named Washington Mr. Basketball by the state coaches association.
Porter was considered a five-star recruit by recruiting services 247Sports and Rivals and a four-star recruit by ESPN. He was the top-ranked player from Washington in the 2018 class and received offers from several NCAA Division I programs, including UCLA, Oregon, and Washington, before committing to USC. Porter became the first USC player since DeMar DeRozan in 2008 to be rated a five-star recruit by Rivals.

Porter debuted for USC on November 6, 2018, scoring 15 points off the bench on 6-of-7 shooting in an 83–62 win over Robert Morris. On November 20, against Missouri State, he suffered a quadriceps contusion. He returned on December 1 versus Nevada but left after 4 minutes because he was hindered by the injury. He missed nine games with a quad contusion, and returned again on January 10, 2019, scoring 5 points in 25 minutes. Three days later, however, he was suspended indefinitely by USC for "personal conduct issues." Regardless, Porter stated that he would finish the season with the team and then played in the last three games of the season. He averaged 9.8 points, four rebounds, and 1.4 assists in 22 minutes a game, playing in 21 of USC’s 33 games.
At the conclusion of his freshman season, Porter announced his intention to forgo his remaining collegiate eligibility and declare for the 2019 NBA draft.
In the 2019 NBA draft, Porter was selected 30th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks, but was later traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers via the Detroit Pistons. On July 3, 2019, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced that they had signed with Porter. On October 23, 2019, Porter made his debut in NBA, started in a 85–94 loss to the Orlando Magic with 1 rebound, two assists and a steal. Porter scored a career high 18 points in 31 minutes in a 123 to 105 loss to the New York Knicks. He finished the game with 18 points, 4 rebounds, 2 assists, and a steal.
Since the start of the 2018–19 season, Porter was projected as a first-round prospect for the 2019 NBA draft. He looks up to James Harden, as both players are left-handed.
