Redress
In film, a redress is the redecoration of an existing movie set, so that it can double for another set. This saves the trouble and expenses of constructing a second, new set, though they face the difficulty of doing it so the average viewer does not notice the same set is reused. Also there could be logistical problems, such as conflicting shooting schedules, continuity if the set is not quite the same as it was (if it should be the same) or different (if it should be). The latter problem arises because the set dresser may be unaware of changes created by the action.
A good example of a successful redress occurred in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan where the bridges of the Enterprise and the Reliant were filmed on the same set. Some of the reasons for its success are as follows:
However, such perfect circumstances are rare and any Trekkie will be quick to point out that the schematics seen on Reliant are clearly those of the Enterprise.
During Hollywood's studio era, the disparate studios often maintained standing sets (interior and exterior) which were intended for long-term use over multiple productions, with only minimal re-dressing. This often led to audience members recognising sets which had appeared in previous films. A double feature of two Twentieth Century-Fox films of the mid-1950s, O. Henry's Full House and We're Not Married, caused unintended laughter[who?] when two different street scenes from the respective films—a street in Manhattan circa 1900, and a street in New Orleans in the present—were very obviously the same exterior set.[citation needed]
