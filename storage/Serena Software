Serena's products and solutions address the following industry segments:
Serena Software acquired Merant Software in 2004 which provided Serena ownership rights to PVCS.
In May 2004, Serena announced it would acquire TeamShare, producers of the defect management system TeamTrack. This later became Serena Business Mashups (SBM), which was shortly renamed Serena Business Manager.
In November 2005, Serena Software announced that it had agreed to be acquired by Silver Lake Partners in a US$1.2 billion leveraged buyout transaction. The buyout was announced at a price of US$24 per share in cash, and the transaction occurred in 2006. Following the transaction, Silver Lake, a technology focused private equity firm acquired about 70% of the Serena stock. The Silver Lake Partners acquisition resulted in no immediate changes to the executive management team and daily operations continued much as they had before.
In October 2006, Serena announced the acquisition of Pacific Edge Software to enter the emerging project portfolio management (PPM) market. Mariner, a leading provider of Project and Portfolio Management (PPM) solutions was determined to be a good match for Serena's existing portfolio of products. After Pacific Edge, Serena made a number of more minor acquisitions, purchasing prototyping technology from Apptero, requirements management technology from Integrated Chipware and asset discovery technology from Data Sciences Corporation.
In September 2008 Serena announced the acquisition of Projity, an open source software as a service (SaaS)-based project management company.

During 2013 Serena tried to address falling profits and increase operating margins by reducing its workforce by some 175 employees, hoping to cut operating expenses for the fiscal year 2014. By July the company had total outstanding debt of USD 410 million.
In March 2014, Serena announced the acquisition of the company by a partnership of founder Doug Troxel and private equity firm HGGC. The acquisition was completed in April 2014.
