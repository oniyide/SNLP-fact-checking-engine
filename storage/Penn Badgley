Penn Dayton Badgley (born November 1, 1986) is an American actor and musician. He is best known for his role as Dan Humphrey in The CW teen drama series Gossip Girl (2007–12) and as Joe Goldberg in the Netflix thriller series You (2018–present).
Badgley has appeared in a number of films, including John Tucker Must Die (2006), The Stepfather (2009), Easy A (2010), Margin Call (2011), and Greetings from Tim Buckley (2012). He is also the lead singer for Brooklyn-based indie band MOTHXR. Their studio album Centerfold was released in 2016.
Badgley was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Lynne Murphy and Duff Badgley, who worked as a newspaper reporter and a carpenter and was the Green Party candidate for governor of Washington in 2008. His parents divorced when he was 12. Badgley split his childhood years between Woodlake, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington. He attended Woolridge Elementary, where his mother became PTA president, before he transferred to St. Christopher's School. He enjoyed playing youth soccer, where his father coached.[citation needed] He attended Charles Wright Academy in Tacoma, Washington, and was involved with the Seattle Children's Theatre. He soon began doing voiceovers for children's radio stations.
At age 11, Badgley relocated to Hollywood and began pursuing an acting career. He also sought a singing career during this time, and recorded a pop single in 1998. At age 14, Badgley completed his California High School Proficiency Exam and began attending Santa Monica College. He was accepted to the University of Southern California, but deferred admission due to contractual obligations, and later enrolled at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon, for two years.
Badgley's first credit was voice work for the video games Mario Golf 64 and Mario Tennis 64 in 1999 and 2000. His first screen acting credit was on an episode of Will & Grace and he subsequently appeared on shows such as Daddio, The Brothers García, and What I Like About You. His first noticeable role was as Phillip Chancellor IV on the soap opera The Young and the Restless, from 2000 to 2001. He was nominated for a 2001 Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Daytime Series for his work.
In 2002, he starred in The WB's comedy-drama series Do Over as Joel Larsen, a 34-year-old man who gets a second chance to get his life right, thanks to a freakish accident that catapults him back to 1980, as a 14-year-old. Badgley went on to star in two other WB series: The Mountain (2004–2005) and The Bedford Diaries (2006). Badgley's first major film credit was 2006's John Tucker Must Die, playing the role of Scott Tucker. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $14.3 million, ranking third in the US box office results for that weekend. Badgley later appeared in Drive-Thru, co-starring future castmate Leighton Meester.
In 2007, Badgley was cast in The CW's teen drama series Gossip Girl as Dan Humphrey, based on the book series of the same name by Cecily von Ziegesar. He initially turned down the role, but accepted after the producers struggled finding someone to fill the role. In 2009, he starred in thriller film The Stepfather, a remake of the 1987 film, as the stepson of the serial killer. Badgley then played Todd, the love interest of Emma Stone's character, in the teen comedy film Easy A (2010).

Months later, the band changed the spelling to MOTHXR, citing a cease-and-desist from another band with a similar name. In 2015, the band signed with the labels Kitsuné and Washington Square Music, the New York City-based subdivision of the Razor & Tie label. The band has supported acts such as Streets of Laredo, San Cisco, Sir Sly, Har Mar Superstar, The Neighbourhood, and Miami Horror. Their debut album, Centerfold, was released February 26, 2016.
