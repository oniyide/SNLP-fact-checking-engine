IntelliCorp (IC) is a software company that provides, develops, and markets SAP application lifecycle management, business process management and data management software for SAP customers and partners. IntelliCorp applications deliver automatic intelligent impact analysis of SAP systems and are SAP Integration Certified.
Founded in 1980, IC marketed an early expert system environment (Knowledge Engineering Environment â€“ KEE) for development and deployment of knowledge systems on the Lisp machines that had several advanced features, such as truth maintenance. KEE used the backward-chaining method of Mycin which had been developed at Stanford. While moving KEE functionality to the PC, IC created one of the early object-oriented technologies for commercial programming development environments (LiveModel).
The company was also one of the UML Partners, a consortium which helped develop the standards for UML, the Unified Modeling Language.
