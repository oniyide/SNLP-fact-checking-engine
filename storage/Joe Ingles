Joe Ingles

Joseph Howarth Ingles (born 2 October 1987) is an Australian professional basketball player for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association. He also represents the Australian national team. Standing at 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m), he primarily plays at the small forward and shooting guard positions, but he is versatile enough to play at the point guard as he often plays a point forward role.
Born in the Adelaide suburb of Happy Valley, Ingles played junior basketball for the Southern Tigers. Ingles attended both Lake Ginninderra College and the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in Canberra with future Boomers teammate Brad Newley. He played basketball for the AIS in 2005 and 2006. Along with basketball, Ingles also played Australian rules football and cricket in his younger years but gave up both sports to focus on basketball.
Ingles' two basketball goals as a boy were to play for the Adelaide 36ers and Australia. He was highly sought after when he came out of the AIS in 2006, and he subsequently met with the 36ers as a 17-year-old, but a couple of Adelaide blunders set him off interstate. Ingles said of the situation, "The minimum salary at the time was $20–$22,000 and while money wasn't a primary concern for me, they offered me a two-year deal at $12,500 per, plus two season tickets." Ingles had several other contract bids to consider, all offering at least the minimum and many of them providing additional incentives. His decision to not sign with the 36ers came when his contract from the club arrived with his name misspelt. It did not leave a glowing impression on Ingles or his family, so he moved his attention to Melbourne.
On 17 March 2006, Ingles signed a multi-year deal with the South Dragons of the National Basketball League, becoming the very first player to sign with the club. In the Dragons' debut game, the 18-year-old Ingles made league history by scoring the most points by an Australian on debut – 29, on 11-of-15 shooting from the field. His excellent first season earned him the NBL Rookie of the Year Award. In 34 games in 2006–07, he averaged 15.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game.
In 2007–08, Ingles played in 30 games for the Dragons, averaging 15.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game.
In 2008–09, Ingles helped lead the Dragons to the minor premiership while earning All-NBL Third Team honours. He went on to help the Dragons win their maiden NBL championship with a 3–2 grand final series victory over the Melbourne Tigers. However, two months after winning their first title, the club folded due to financial difficulties. In 38 games for the club in 2008–09, Ingles averaged 13.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game.
In 102 games for the Dragons over three seasons, Ingles averaged 14.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game.
In July 2009, Ingles signed with Spanish club CB Granada of the Liga ACB. In November 2010, Ingles transferred from Granada to FC Barcelona, signing a three-year deal with the club. In June 2013, Ingles announced that he would not re-sign with Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.
On 24 July 2013, Ingles signed with Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv. Ingles and Maccabi, led by head coach David Blatt, went on to win the 2013–14 EuroLeague championship.
