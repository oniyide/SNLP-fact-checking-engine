Otto Porter Jr. (born June 3, 1993) is a professional American basketball player for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Georgetown Hoyas and was selected with the third overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Washington Wizards. He was considered one of the top college basketball players before entering the NBA.
Porter attended Scott County Central High School which includes the small towns of Morley, Vanduser, Haywood City, and parts of rural Sikeston. He earned all-state honors as a junior and senior leading the Braves to three straight Class 1 state championships and giving Scott Central its state-record 15th title overall. During his senior year, he helped lead the Braves to 29–2 record, averaging 30 points and 14 rebounds a game.
Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Porter was listed as the No. 8 power forward and the No. 37 player in the nation in 2011.
He signed a letter of intent with the Georgetown Hoyas and played his first game with them on November 12, 2011 against the Savannah State Tigers, recording 9 points, 8 rebounds and 3 blocks. Rounding out his freshman year, Porter averaged 9.7 points per game and 6.8 rebounds per game. As a sophomore, he nearly doubled his points production, averaging 16.2 points and 7.5 rebounds per game.
At the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, Porter led his team to a 25–7 record and a number 2 seed in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. For his efforts, he was named the Big East Player of the Year and was a finalist for both the Naismith Trophy and Wooden Award. In the first round of the Men's Championship Basketball, Porter recorded 13 points and 11 rebounds in a 78–68 upset loss to the 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast University Eagles on March 22, 2013.
On April 15, 2013, Porter announced his decision to forgo his final two years of eligibility and enter the NBA draft.
Porter was selected with the third overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Washington Wizards. However, he missed training camp and the first 18 games of the 2013–14 season with a hip injury. He made his NBA debut on December 6, going scoreless in 14 minutes in a 109–105 overtime loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. He twice scored a season-high nine points in April 2014. On November 1, 2014, he scored 19 of his career-high 21 points in the second half of the Wizards' 108–97 win over the Bucks.

According to ESPN's Real Plus-Minus, a player's estimated on-court impact on team performance, Porter was the most efficient scorer in the NBA among 115 players with at least 800 possessions, penetrating defenses in transition and as a spot-up shooter. His three-point shooting percentage was fourth best in the NBA.

Two days later, the Wizards received the offer sheet, with the goal being to match the offer.
