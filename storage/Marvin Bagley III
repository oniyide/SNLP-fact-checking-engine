Marvin Bagley III (born March 14, 1999) is an American professional basketball player for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils and was a 2018 Consensus All-American. He was selected with the second overall pick by the Kings in the 2018 NBA draft. On May 21, he was selected to the 2018–19 NBA All-Rookie First Team.
Bagley attended Corona del Sol High School in Tempe, Arizona as a freshman and Hillcrest Prep in Phoenix, Arizona as a sophomore. During that sophomore year, he was teammates with future #1 pick Deandre Ayton. In 2016, he transferred to Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth, California. He was ruled ineligible to play his first year at Sierra Canyon due to California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) rules. That ruling would help play a factor into reclassifying his senior year of high school up a year early. In his last season for Sierra Canyon, he averaged 24.9 points per game and 10.1 rebounds per game. He would be named for the All-USA Today First-team in 2017.
Bagley was rated as a five-star recruit throughout his high school career and was formerly ranked as the top player in the 2018 class before his reclassification. His first college basketball scholarship came from Northern Arizona University when he was 14.
