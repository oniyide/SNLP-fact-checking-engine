Khalil gave birth to their son on April 17, 2010, during an at home water birth. Bryton James is his godfather  and actress Fadhia Marcelin is his godmother.

She is also friends with several former The Young and the Restless co-stars, including Mishael Morgan and Nadine Heimann. In October 2015, she modeled for Heimann's non-profit, True Connection.
In June 2015, after the United States Supreme Court's decision on Obergefell v. Hodges, she voiced her support for same-sex marriage.
